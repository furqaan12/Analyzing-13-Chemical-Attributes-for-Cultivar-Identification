Exploring Wine Classification with Naive Bayes Algorithm" is a data analysis project that aims to build a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the cultivar of wines based on 13 chemical attributes. The project uses a wine dataset from the UCI machine learning repository, which contains data from three different cultivars of wines grown in the same region in Italy. The project involves preprocessing and cleaning the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, training a Naive Bayes classifier on the training set, and evaluating its performance on the testing set. The project also includes the computation of various performance metrics such as the confusion matrix, sensitivity, specificity, total accuracy, F1-score, and the visualization of the ROC curve and area under curve.
